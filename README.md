# The Unofficial Guide — Project 1

## Domain

<!-- What topic or category of knowledge does your system cover?
     Why is this knowledge valuable, and why is it hard to find through official channels?
     Example: "Student reviews of CS professors at [university] — useful because official
     course descriptions don't reflect teaching style, exam difficulty, or workload." -->
     
This system covers student-generated knowledge about the Computer Science department at Brooklyn College (CUNY). It includes professor reviews, course advice, program requirements, and informal student opinions that are difficult to find through official channels. Official sources like course catalogs and department websites describe what courses exist, but don't reflect teaching style, exam difficulty, workload, or which professors are worth taking. This system makes that informal knowledge searchable and answerable.

## Chunking Strategy

<!-- Describe your chunking approach with enough specificity that someone else could reproduce it.
     Include:
     - Chunk size (characters or tokens) and why that size fits your documents
     - Overlap size and why (or why not) you used overlap
     - Any preprocessing you did before chunking (e.g., stripping HTML, removing headers)
     - What your final chunk count was across all documents -->

**Chunk size:** 200 tokens

**Overlap:** 30 tokens

**Why these choices fit your documents:** The corpus is dominated by short-form review and opinion content from RateMyProfessors, Reddit, and Discord, where individual posts are naturally self-contained units of meaning. A smaller chunk size of 200 tokens preserves these atomic opinions without merging unrelated reviews together. The longer structured documents like syllabi and PDFs are also well-served by this size since their key information tends to appear in discrete paragraphs. A 30-token overlap ensures that sentences split across chunk boundaries don't lose context without introducing excessive redundancy. Before chunking, documents were cleaned to remove URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, and PDF table of contents formatting using regex preprocessing.

**Final chunk count:** 980 chunks across 10 documents

## Embedding Model

<!-- Name the embedding model you used and explain your choice.
     Then answer: if you were deploying this system for real users and cost wasn't a constraint,
     what tradeoffs would you weigh in choosing a different model?
     Consider: context length limits, multilingual support, accuracy on domain-specific text,
     latency, and local vs. API-hosted. -->

**Model used:** all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via sentence-transformers.

**Production tradeoff reflection:** In a production deployment, several tradeoffs would need to be weighed. A larger API-hosted model like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large would likely produce more accurate embeddings, especially for nuanced queries, but introduces per-request cost and latency. Context length is another consideration, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 has a 256-token limit, which means longer chunks get truncated silently. A model with a longer context window would handle the PDF chunks more accurately. For this project, the local model was the right choice given the scale and constraints.

## Grounded Generation

<!-- Explain how your system enforces grounding — how does it prevent the LLM from answering
     beyond the retrieved documents?
     Describe both your system prompt (what instruction you gave the model) and any structural
     choices (e.g., how you formatted the context, whether you filtered low-relevance chunks).
     Do not just say "I told it to use the documents" — show the actual instruction or explain
     the mechanism. -->

**System prompt grounding instruction:** "You are a helpful assistant for students at Brooklyn College's CS department. Answer the question using ONLY the information provided in the documents below. If the documents don't contain enough information to answer, say exactly: 'I don't have enough information on that.' Do not use any outside knowledge. Do not make anything up."

**How source attribution is surfaced in the response:** Source filenames are extracted programmatically from ChromaDB metadata for every retrieved chunk and appended to every response, regardless of what the LLM generates. This means attribution is structurally guaranteed rather than left to the model to include on its own.

## Evaluation Report

<!-- Run your 5 test questions from planning.md through your system and record the results.
     Be honest — a partially accurate or inaccurate result that you explain well is more
     valuable than a suspiciously perfect result. -->

| # | Question | Expected answer | System response (summarized) | Retrieval quality | Response accuracy |
|---|----------|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | What programming languages are CS undergrad students required to learn?|Java and C++ (from undergraduate.pdf) | Correctly identified Java and C++ as required languages| Partially relevant| Accurate|
| 2 |What specialization does the CS department recommend for a graduate student that wishes to pursue a PhD? | Computation track (from graduate.pdf)| Correctly identified the Computation track as recommended for doctoral studies|Partially relevant | Accurate|
| 3 | Are Professor Ziegler's exams pen and paper? Short answers or multiple choice? And are they allowed a cheat sheet?| Pulled from Discord|Found partial information — noted that some professors allow cheat sheets but couldn't confirm for Ziegler specifically. Correctly said it didn't have enough information rather than guessing | Partially relevant|Partially accurate |
| 4 |What negative feedback do students give about Professor Ziegler? |Pulled from Discord |Returned 5 specific complaints grounded entirely in Discord content: poor lecture skills, vague instructions, stressful assignments, reads from slides | Relevant| Accurate|
| 5 |If I take the expedited masters, does taking the graduate level computer theory course fulfill both undergrad and grad requirements at the same time? | Pulled from department website|Returned "I don't have enough information on that" despite relevant content existing in the Discord export | Off-target| Inaccurate|

**Retrieval quality:** Relevant / Partially relevant / Off-target  
**Response accuracy:** Accurate / Partially accurate / Inaccurate

## Failure Case Analysis

<!-- Identify at least one question where retrieval or generation did not work as expected.
     Write a specific explanation of *why* it failed, tied to a part of the pipeline.

     "The answer was wrong" is not an explanation.

     "The relevant information was split across a chunk boundary, so retrieval returned
     only half the context — the model didn't have enough to answer correctly" is an explanation.

     "The embedding model treated the professor's nickname as out-of-vocabulary and returned
     results from an unrelated review" is an explanation. -->

**Question that failed:** "If I take the expedited masters, does taking the graduate level computer theory course fulfill both undergrad and grad requirements at the same time?"

**What the system returned:** "I don't have enough information on that." even though the Discord export contained a message from Professor Chuang discussing how courses count toward graduation requirements in the expedited masters program.

**Root cause (tied to a specific pipeline stage):** This is a retrieval failure. The relevant Discord chunk existed in the corpus but was not ranked in the top 5 results because the query language ("expedited masters", "fulfill both requirements") didn't semantically match the language used in the Discord message ("capstone courses", "24 credits of advanced courses"). The embedding model couldn't bridge the gap between the query phrasing and the document phrasing, so the relevant chunk was never passed to the LLM.

**What you would change to fix it:**  Query expansion or rephrasing before retrieval would help, either automatically generating alternative phrasings of the query or using a hybrid search approach that combines semantic search with keyword matching to catch exact term matches like "expedited masters."

## Spec Reflection

<!-- Reflect on how planning.md shaped your implementation.
     Answer both questions with at least 2–3 sentences each. -->

**One way the spec helped you during implementation:** The spec's advice to test retrieval before adding generation was critical. Early retrieval tests revealed that distance scores were consistently above 0.7, which led to debugging the chunking strategy and reducing chunk size from 350 to 200 tokens. Without that intermediate checkpoint, those retrieval failures would have been much harder to diagnose after the LLM was already wired in.

**One way your implementation diverged from the spec, and why:** The spec suggested using LangChain for chunking and pipeline management, but the implementation used manual chunking instead. After reviewing a prior project that used a similar sliding window approach, it was clear that LangChain added abstraction without adding value for a corpus this size. Writing the chunking function manually made it easier to debug chunk boundaries and understand exactly what was being embedded.

## AI Usage

<!-- Describe at least 2 specific instances where you used an AI tool during this project.
     For each: what did you give the AI as input, what did it produce, and what did you
     change, override, or direct differently?

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not sufficient.
     "I gave Claude my Chunking Strategy section from planning.md and asked it to implement
     chunk_text(). It returned a function using a fixed character split. I overrode the
     chunk size from 500 to 200 because my documents are short reviews, not long guides." -->

**Instance 1**

- *What I gave the AI:* The Chunking Strategy section of planning.md, the document list, and the pipeline diagram
- *What it produced:* A chunk_text() function using a sliding window with configurable chunk size and overlap, and separate loader functions for PDFs, txt files, and HTML exports
- *What I changed or overrode:* The initial chunk size was 350 tokens, which was later reduced to 200 after retrieval testing showed that chunks were too large and mixing multiple topics together, causing retrieval to return off target results



**Instance 2**

- *What I gave the AI:* The Retrieval Approach section of planning.md, the ChromaDB setup, and the Groq model choice
- *What it produced:* The embed.py and query.py files including the grounding prompt, retrieval function, and Gradio interface skeleton
- *What I changed or overrode:* The initial implementation re-embedded all chunks every time the app was launched. This was changed to check collection.count() first and skip embedding if the database already existed, reducing startup time from ~30 seconds to instant
